* The repository exists to make https://bit-team.github.io available.
* It is a dummy "website" simply redirecting to the primary repository https://github.com/bit-team/backintime
* The header of the "website" contain a "rel=me" link to verify our Mastodon account ([@backintime@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@backintime)) having a green checkmark their. That was the primary reason to create that repo.
* The markdown render of Microsoft GitHub does remove "rel=me" links. That is why we need this workaround using Microsoft GitHub pages.
